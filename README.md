This is a file used to explain what your repo is all about, there are different ways to format the text you use in here. We can see above how headings and bullet points are
shown. Below are a couple more useful tips and tricks.

Want to **Bold Text**?
Want to *Italicize Text*?
Want to create a ~~Stroke tough~~? Sorry I meant Strikethrough 

There are also headings: 
- # Heading 1
- ## Heading 2
- ### Heading 3
- #### Heading 4

And finally a blockquote ; although there are a lot of other things you can do with an md file and it would be a good idea to look up some shortcuts whenever you are writing one

> this is a blockquote? When would you use something like this?
